4-L10,story.mp3,"<speak> The Great Migration Every year, millions of monarch butterflies make an incredible journey. They travel up to 3,000 miles from Canada and the United States to the mountains of central Mexico. This trip is called the Great Migration. It is one of the most amazing events in nature. The butterflies fly south to escape the cold winter. They gather in forests where the temperature is just right — not too hot and not too cold. Scientists are still learning how monarchs navigate such huge distances. Some believe they use the sun as a compass. Others think they may sense Earth's magnetic field..<break time='1s'/> Sadly, monarch populations have been declining. Loss of habitat and changes in climate threaten their survival. Conservation groups are working to plant milkweed — the only plant where monarchs lay their eggs — to help save these remarkable insects.</speak>","Read this like a friendly, clear teacher reading a story to a student:"
